STATUS of project
Project is complete on a basic level, functions of add, remove and print have been 
implemented and are working properly. Parts that required synchronziation were the shared resource of the 
playlist (ArrayList "songs"). If i had more time i would've liked to implement the spotift API and use it 
to create a physical playlist and add and remove songs through there.
